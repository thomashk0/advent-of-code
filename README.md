# Solutions for the Advent of Code programming puzzles

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/).
Not all solution are cleaned-up neither optimized.
They are mostly written in C++17, Haskell, Python, some redundant types and utilities are factored into the [aoc](./aoc) library.

# Usage

```console
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
